## Cloud

Since 2017 I have worked exclusively in The Cloud. Considerable experience with GCP, AWS and Azure in both startup and enterprise settings.

Whether you are migrating existing workloads to cloud or are starting from scratch I can help.

## Kubernetes. Docker. Containers.

Containers are the de-facto standard units of deployment.

Kubernetes is the de-facto standard way of orchestrating deployments of containers.

I can help you from creating your first Docker image all the way to scaling out complex and elastic workloads.

## DevOps. SRE. CI/CD.

The agility of your business depends on the pace you can develop solutions and adapt to changing conditions.

Your developers happiness relies on tools that aid them, not restrict them.

Your customers happiness relies on robust and reliable systems.

We have long experience with balancing the need for low-friction high-pace development and high-stability low-risk deployments.

## Observability. Monitoring.

> If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it. (Peter Drucker)

There are vast amounts of data that can be collected to observe modern IT systems. But it can be hard to turn that data into knowledge and action.

I have used data-driven approaches to building fast, efficient and scalable systems for almost a decade.

## Architecture

Great architecture can make a system easy to maintain, easy to extend and easy to scale.

## Development. Golang.

Sometimes what we need doesn't exist, yet.

I have been developing on and off for the last decade. 

From 2018 to 2021 I was primarily building systems, particularly APIs, using Golang. I strive to make programs that are fault tolerant, performant, scalable and extendable.

I also have experience with other popular languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Databases. PostgreSQL.

Chances are your system contains one, a few, or a myriad of databases.

A thoughtful approach to database-design enables you rather than constrain you.

I have experience in designing and refactoring databases and their data to eliminate bottlenecks, increase efficiency and reduce cost.

This includes the data structures (schemas), access-patterns, indexes, views and most importantly queries that are easy to reason about yet extremely performant.

I have used PostgreSQL, including geo-spatial extensions, for many years and is in my opinion the standard choice unless specific requirements necessitates more specialized solutions.
